## FAQ
### Why do JSON Schema files need to be split from main (DB) repository?
In short, we need the JSON schema to always be active from the server-end while the database repository is under maintenance.

### Can I, as an outside contributor, issue or edit the schema?
Of course! You can submit a issue via the [jsonschema/issues](https://github.com/ryuuganime/jsonschema/issues) provided by GitHub, or you can also edit the current version of the JSON schema file directly by forking, commit, and send pull requests when you're done editing.
